While this final version (for submission) deletes zeroes, it _fails to delete most of them_.

At the time, a fix was underway to perform the following (in order of importance):
1. Revise zero deletion algorithm for a better, if not perfect, detection rate.
2. Integrate zero deletion into matrix addition phase to avoid performing an additional matrix read operation.
3. Convert linked lists of linked lists to an array of linked lists as per assignment specification.

The clock hit midnight. Pencils down. Turn in your test. Leave the room in an orderly fashion.
(1) was never achieved, so the rest were never attempted.

(The revised version is not uploaded due to not having any significant changes.)
